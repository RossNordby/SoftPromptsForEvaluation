In the Guardian, my friend Jack Shenker talks to Mohamed ElBaradei about the risks of a Tunisia-like uprising in Egypt — which ElBaradei does not want:
"What has transpired in Tunisia is no surprise and should be very instructi？"
In the case of Tunisia, if we do not understand what happened, the incident will be interpreted as a "Tunisia uprising" and will be a cover for the Tunisia-style revolution.

May 4, 9:40 am	Winning Isn’t Everything: ‘Lombardi’ to Close on Broadway
By PATRICK HEALY	Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Dan Lauria in the title role in “Lombardi.”
“Lombardi,” the play that tried to draw men to Broadway with a “lamb to f” ad, quickly went off the rails, leaving the U.S. audience on their feet. Lombardi is an American-Italian-French drama about the role of a banker’s son who loses his money to a madman’s rival.
“Lombardi” was the premiere of LOMBARDI, a three-act play that was released in September 2007 and was adapted by Jeffrey Jones and co-written by James Saunders and Steven Kagan.

The external waveform used for the processing of the *ν*~*ω*~ is shown in [Fig. 1](#f1){ref-type="fig"}. For the very early *ν*~*ω*~ (before the first *ν*~*ω*~), a voltage pulse appears with a frequency proportional to the wavenumber (e.g., *ν*~*ω*~= *ν*~*ω*~ × 10^−3^). The time-scale at which the signal reaches its maximum amplitude is governed by the measurement frequency of the wavenumber *ν*~*ω*~
