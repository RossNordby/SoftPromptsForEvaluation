From the above picture, it appears that parents and teachers of both the Amish and Protestant denominations share similar beliefs, though they differ in many ways. Amish leaders believe in “replacing” their children with Amish-style home school, while Protestants believe that “planning is better than selling.” (and those with religious views don’t.) Protestants believe that religious institutions should be abolished, while Amish leaders believe in the salvation of all people by grace.
