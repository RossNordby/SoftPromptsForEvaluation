[SOFT PROMPT]Densely informative loss functions have an advantage in optimization landscapes that of the participants are small enough to be efficiently estimated by a variety of strategies, while retaining the signal to noise ratio. A common method for analyzing binary classification problems with a multi-class setting is to estimate the output distribution, i.e. the conditional distribution of the output given the input. However, estimating this distribution is often not computationally tractable, since it requires solving the multi-class logistic regression (MLR) problem. To address this issue, the task of estimating the output distribution has been investigated in the context of binary classification problems, with different loss functions. In particular, the *adversarial loss* (AL)

Here's what you need to know to take your best shot at beating heart disease.
In a study of nearly 3,000 heart attack survivors, researchers found that people who were more upbeat, confident and optimistic tended to live longer after an attack.
The study, which was published in the journal Circulation, also showed that those who thought they would die within a year had a higher chance of surviving.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers are reconsidering a 1990 law that makes the State Department accept the lowest bids for contractThe word is out on the "housekeeping" in the United States: the government will make its lowest-priced government-owned civilian contract available to private firms in return for a promise to avoid such conduct as occurs in the future. The bottom line: the government will not have to sell its contract to the lowest bidder.
The bill, known as the National Security Services Act, was designed to save the State Department from a scandal over political appointees, and it passed Congress by a whopping vote of 205-85 in the Republican-controlled House. The law, which went into effect in 1990, is currently the

With the pressure off him from golf, Tiger Woods, the longest-tenured golfer on the PGA Tour, is no longer trying to "run up the leaderboard" at tournaments.

By Cody Swartz

It’s notoriously difficult to grade offensive linemen, especially considering there are very limited statistics to evaluate their performance. The Pro Bowl v-guard position is by far the most difficult to evaluate. There is simply no meaningful data that can be gathered from players who aren’t on the field.
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that offensive linemen rarely play in games.
All teams play in the same games, and it is hard to evaluate linemen when they don’t play in the same games. As such, there is no meaningful data that can be gathered from linemen who aren’t on the field.

Perhaps the medium really is  done. It is a story that seems to have been completely forgotten since the Vietnam War, when journalists rushed to a "Newspaper War" to put their reporting to the test. (Even the great columnist Howard Cosell can't bring himself to call the reporters who wrote the stories "Newspaper writers".) For the most part, we have just come to appreciate the sheer artistry of the reporting of the major media. It's an art form that will never be completely replicated, but it's as close as it can be.

[SOFT PROMPT]Sen. Harry Reid’s Fundraiser Gets 2 Years in Prison
By Kent Cooper	Posted at 2:23 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2013
A Nevada lawyer and lobbyist who was a fundraiser for the 2010 re-election campaign of Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been sentenced to two years in prison-in the third case of its kind.

Scott Shakman, 38, was convicted of conspiracy to commit extortion and racketeering conspiracy in the case that included allegations of bribery, extortion, and money laundering. Shakman was also convicted of obstructing justice in the case involving Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and a former state legislator.

Prosecutors allege that Shakman and a former law clerk for the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, used their connections with McConnell’s campaign and lobbyists to target victims and force them to pay extortion money.

In this paper, we consider an approach that employs novel neural network architectures to decode spoken language into phonetic and other speech representations. This is a variant of the Deep-LSTM model introduced by Poggio et al. (2013) that has the advantage of requiring only a few feature engineering steps, as opposed to the more common Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model. We evaluate our approach on the task of phonetic speech recognition and show that our method is significantly more accurate than existing methods.---

Today's death has me thinking about the stories of the past that get repeated. The stories that, despite some bad turns of events, we all find ourselves believing. Like the guy who went into a gas station, got hit by a car, and wound up dying. I've been told this story many times, by people who know the guy, and have spent time with him. The guy in the story was very well known. I remember when I was in my twenties, a good friend and I were
