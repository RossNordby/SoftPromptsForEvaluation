The reality of it is that the human race has been hanging out in the dark ages for millennia. There is a long line of evolution, which started with our closest relative, the chimpanzee, and has gone up through a series of species.

6 out of 10 people think that learning how to use email is important to a successful business.



The problem with this idea is that this isn’t true.

My experience is that people aren’t ready to put their attention into learning something.

In fact, the people who are the most willing to put their time and effort into learning something are the ones who are more successful.

The reason is that it’s easier for them to learn something than it is for you to learn something.

"What has transpired in Tunisia is no surprise and should be very instructi_ng to Egyptians. They are accustomed to seeing politics reflected in their daily lives. What they are not accustomed to is seeing that it is possible for politics to be reversed and for a country to take a position that has not been previously seen as acceptable."

Mohamed ElBaradei, Egypt's first democratically elected prime minister, was speaking at the Forum on International Political Economy in London on 23 February.

I need some clarification hEnterprises: from the mundane to the big. From a start-up to a multinational with $20B in revenue. From a SME to a large company with $1B in revenue.
By adopting Friedmanite economics, we can design products that have economic value, so we can make a profit. The problem is that people in our business world don't care about this stuff. We can afford to design products that have a net economic value, but we can't afford to design products that have a net economic value. We are constrained by what we can afford.

 An excellent summary of the political, diplomatic, and military dimensions of the crisis in Syria. In the end, it is not clear that the United States will be able to act decisively to prevent a military escalation. There are many options open to the Obama administration. The President can seek to de-escalate the conflict by suspending all arms sales to the Syrian regime and striking the Assad regime militarily. Alternatively, the President could intervene in Syria through diplomatic negotiations. The military option is likely to be a political and military failure.
