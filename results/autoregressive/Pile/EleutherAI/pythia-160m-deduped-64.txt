Ciara danced to Michael Jackon’s “Billie Jean” during Vh1 Divas. She earned cheers from the, of course, Kurt Cobain audience. I had to rewatch Ciara and Crikey’s 2003 effort. The Hurt Locker trailer makes me think Ciara has gone and done some things to make me feel like I’m in the Trap Room, and, I suspect, I’m not. One of the things I really like about Ciara is how easily she (and all her other roles) let her faux friends go through such traumatic events, even in the most cringeworthy moments. She did get cheered by some of the many fans who were involved with the Hurt Locker tour

I married my music teacher. While that has brought me many musical opportunities, it also keeps me from practicing as much as I might like. I hate to make student noises when she's trying to r no?

Greetings, loved ones. LET’S TAKE A JOURNEY.
First up in links this week, we’ve got The  campaign. As you can see, I’m not the only one who thinks we can save the world from all of this government corruption and help our country survive. This campaign will continue with an emphasis on protecting people from the corruption, violence, sexual harassment, and the senseless destruction of innocent people. It will include supporting the criminals, the criminals, and the organized criminals and providing for the victims.
What’s going on here? Well, first of all, we are going to look at the foundation of our country, the foundation of our country. And we are going to help the people in our country be protected from this

Having grown weary of a seemingly endless string of flights for the past two weeks, I opted to drive from Northern California to Southern California (and back) this week. It was illogical, rea, the vehicle, and the particular parts of the motor apparatus. We had been aware of the power issue since we were leaving and had attempted to avoid it. Fortunately, it didn't take long to figure out what was happening and now I can appreciate the intensity of the desire to give the power back to the vehicle. I can see the growing realization that there is more to come, and that it will be different from the prefect vehicle and its driver, but I will try to maintain that perspective in the future. I don't want to put all of this out there, but for those of you who are wondering what happened to me
