The real problem facing Novosibirsk in the wake of The Great Cat-astrophe of 1846 was the defunct Russian Empire, the nominal political reality that existed prior to the Russian Revolution. This was a nation, after all, in the heart of the heartland of Russian civilization. If we have learned anything from history, it is that the Russian people are inherently warlike, and will most likely fight for the right to exist. That’s why it was a crime for Novosibirsk to spend millions of rubles on a system that is so fundamentally flawed.

What’s even more striking is that Russia is the only nation in the world that, in spite of all the violence, does not believe in

No Ben means no win for Steelers
By Buck Frank (bfrank@altoonamirror.com)
Save | PITTSBURGH - It was a typical Steelers-Bal-timore Ravens game Sunday night. Neither team was able to muster much offensively, but they both had enough of each other to put the game away.
After the game, there was some brouhaha when PITTSBURGH residents began getting their morning newspaper. It was, of course, fake. It was also, to some extent, a fake story about the Steelers not having to play the Ravens on Sunday.
"How does that happen?" asked one Pittsburgh resident. "How does it not affect the Ravens game?"
"I don't know, but I'll bet the Steelers didn't play well Sunday," replied another.
So, the fake story went out.

Sola Fide (Latin, "By the code") was the rule of law, i.e. that a king, even if he had no real power, had the law in his favor.

Sola Fide was not only a concept of the modern legal code, but it also has a very old and noble meaning, as it is a title for the law of the

“Lombardi,” the play that tried to draw men to Broadway with a youngster’s celebration of the joy of winning, has closed after nearly two months.
The play, which opened Sept. 28 at the Theater at Lincoln Center, wound up two and a half weeks short of its first Broadway engagement.
A woman in the play, played by Meghan Nunez, is looking for a way to express her grief over the death of her husband, Frank, a boxer who died in a violent accident last summer.

AMD (NYSE: AMD) isn't joking when i say that i love the desktop CPU. AMD is quite serious when it comes to the CPU market. The Ryzen 3000 series is a game changer, but it is not just a game changer. It is a revolution.
AMD is one of the few companies that have managed to combine the performance of a desktop CPU with the security of a notebook.
At this moment, there is no better combination than the Ryzen 3000 series.

By Cody Swartz
Rob Carr/Getty Images 16.3K
It’s notoriously difficult to grade offensive linemen, especially considering there are very limited statistics to evaluate their performance. The Pro Bowl vets that most receive acclaim are usually guys like Pouncey, McFadden, and Murray, and all of them have to be compared to the top of their respective positions.
As a result, it’s easy to take their play at face value, but it’s also easy to overlook the fact that linemen are usually evaluated in different ways. Take the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine for example, where most of the attention was given to the fact that the most dominant lineman was in the middle of the line.

ARMing desktop Linux
By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols
October 12, 2009 1:43 PM EDT
For a brief time in 2008, Linux actually owned a segment of the desktop industry: netbooks. When netbooks first showed up, they ran only Linux. Microsoft panicked anew, as netbooks became more popular. In 2009, Linux finally eclipsed netbooks in the market. In early 2009, Microsoft’s Windows 8 was available for netbooks. Linux was not as popular as Windows 8, but the market share of Linux on netbooks was small.
As netbooks were getting more popular, Microsoft saw the opportunity to expand its market. The two companies collaborated to create a Linux-based operating system that could be used on netbooks. The Microsoft approach was to target a niche market, rather than a broad market. This strategy has worked: netbooks have become a broad market for Linux.

Greetings, loved ones. LET’S TAKE A JOURNEY.
First up in links this week, we’ve got The ******s, the Doomsday Devices, a stolen jet, the domestic NSA surveillance, and the clandestine, covert, and under the radar, NSA programs. We’ve also got some odd ass shit to share with you, like the mysterious song about a former Washington Monument to Stephen King’s the Unbreakable Cycle, an Obama birthday video, and a lot more. Enjoy.

Jeter captains Turn 2 Foundation event (Doug Miller, 1/31/08, MLB.com)
...but you can hardly expect him to call it quits right after a performance like this. In the seventh inning, the Yankees' Yogi Berra is a bat-throwing moneymaker. And in the ninth inning, he is hitting his stride.
The fact is that he is not only a well-known figure, he is a remarkable figure.
Jeter, 32, is the most talented player in the American League, and yet he is one of the most popular, in a way.
It's hard to find fault with Jeter. He is an admirable leader.
He is a brilliant player.
And yet he is a remarkable figure

I have only read three books on the subject of the Civil War. The best one, of course, was Lincoln’s Last Year, but I have not read another one since.

So what did I think of Lincoln? I am still not convinced that it is the most important book of the Civil War. If you want a book that really captures the spirit of the war, I would suggest The Gettysburg Address. It is the best one, in my opinion. I also like Emerson’s essay “Civil Disobedience.”

Professor Martin writes,
With respect to our current "Hearing Loss Protection Act," it appears that our current "Due Process Clause" is not only violated by the present statute, but by the current California statute that gives judges the discretion to refuse to convict a person based on their ability to hear. The language of the current statute appears to say that any person convicted of a "crime" is guilty. And in the current case, the judge has decided to convict based on the fact that Cordell can't hear. This is in violation of our "Due Process Clause."
