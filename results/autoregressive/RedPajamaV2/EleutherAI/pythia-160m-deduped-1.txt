by: Frank Deford, NPR, April 16, 2014 2:04:00 am
Frank Deford says there'll never be another Tiger Woods of any sport. // AFP/Getty Images, Karim Sahib
Tiger Woods hasn't won a major in six years, and at 38, s to be no more of a total P&M. Now, when Tiger Woods won a major, he was 40.
So far, Tiger Woods has not won a major since winning the No. 1 ranking in 2007. But he won one of the biggest awards in Tiger Woods history.
Tiger Woods won the Masters to become the youngest ever winner of the U.S. Open.
For Tiger Woods, the ultimate challenge is who will win the tournament.
As I write, Tiger Woods is heading into the final week of the summer, when the champion will face his second-place rival, Cristiano Ronaldo.

For a brief time in 2008, Linux actually owned a segment of the desktop industry: netbooks. When netbooks first showed up, they ran only Linux. Microsoft panicked an, but they were part of the PC platform and made the transition to Windows. They were in a similar position in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. They weren't very good at switching from Linux to Windows. Linux was old, obsolete, and poorly maintained, and they weren’t doing much of anything. In the late 1990s, netbooks came in, so that wasn’t a problem, but they were still in the mid-2000s.
The first release of Netbooks was the late 1990s, and there were a number of other releases in the last decade, most notably the Pentium 4

It's the same as published books and the same as hard boiled crime books. This is due to the fact that some authors like to use the text to write novel endings.
