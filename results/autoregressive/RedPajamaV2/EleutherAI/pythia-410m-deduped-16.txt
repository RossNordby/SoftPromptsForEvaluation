i am a libertarian, and i support free market, capitalism, liberty, free trade, and individual liberty. my major problem is that the communist style revolution that the communist ideology describes, or the way that socialism works, is not what i think.
my argument is that the communist ideology would have much more success if the communists took control of the government, rather than the states, and worked to make the private sector function properly.
it's really up to us to determine the effectiveness of communism, or the benefits of capitalism, or the "socialism" of the states, etc.

I analysis of evolution in biblical context, to conclude that the theory of evolution is a false theory that must be rejected. And it wasn't the only false argument I made. It's important to note that I was not saying that evolution was true.

The world according to a couch potato
http://berkenschonken.blogspot.com/2010/08/up-and-down.html
This is a blog that is about up and downs. I use the word ups and downs in the sense of ups and downs in the sense of there being ups and downs in the sense of up and downs in the sense of there being ups and downs.
I think that in order to be able to say things like that it is necessary to have some basic definitions.
The basic definition is that it is a conversation that can only

It’s been 4 years since Anushka Sharma appeared on the big screen and entered Bollywood staring opposite one of the most popula known for her role in Wanted and then starring in her own vehicle The Son, we have seen Anushka on TV a lot before, with her role in The Princess Diaries and other dramas, but never as a lead actress in a movie. Anushka is not known for her acting prowess, and in this case she proves it by facing the biggest challenge yet.
A 22 year old woman from Kerala, Anushka was a contestant on the Tamil version of The Voice and had the chance to appear on a new version of the show. This time around she had the role of the Queen of Tamil who

[SOFT PROMPT]Game 159: Yankees at Blue Jays
Nick Swisher called this “a must win game” for the Yankees, and after yesterday’s deflating 3-2 loss to the Blue Jays, it has to be.
At this point, they all are must-win games for the Bombers, who enter today tied once again  anything. They get in the post-season this year and play a very weak team. In fact, the Bombers are currently 4th in the AL East with a.233 batting average and 9.2% of their batting average is hit by pitching. The Blue Jays, on the other hand, are currently 8th in the AL with a.238 batting average and 8.8% of their batting average is hit by pitching. The Bombers are actually a tad better in both of those categories, but in the AL East, it’s much more interesting.
I think the Blue Jays are better off playing a

Best bets for book clubs
BookPage® Column by Julie Hale
This month's new paperback releases include several excellent titles in fiction and nonfiction. We recommend the following selections as good choices for reading groups.Honky-possiblantly, tentatively, and tentatively at the last minute, and tentatively but only after the sale of the right property and before the purchase of the wrong property, the late former great American writer is awarded his last "privilege." It's no secret that for some, it is an honor, and for others, a tragedy. As a nation, we can't afford to have the privilege of having one of our own on the throne. In his book, "In Our Own Words," first published in 1964, Salzman explores the politics of the publishing industry, the changing nature of book publishing,

Certain people will have more power and control over a woman than others, but we all have the right to our own choice. In the case of Porsha Stewart, her male partner has made it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. In fact, it is quite obvious that he has no interest in her as a woman. His actions have gone far beyond what he has asked her to do. Porsha is rightfully in the crosshairs of many men, and that is something we should not allow to happen. Porsha’

Last month I started a serious, ongoing, multi-part series of articles about life as an artist. In my previous pieces I mentioned that I have a serious problem with the way I see the world and that my music is meant to serve a different purpose. In the current article I want to talk about how my life is a result of my choice to write about life as an artist, a story, a metaphor, and a statement of hope.
I started this series because I wanted to write about something that I'm interested in, something I feel passionate

to find our way home, to break in these bones*
Having grown weary of a seemingly endless string of flights for the past two weeks, I opted to drive from Northern California to Southern California (and back) this week. It was illogical, rea the wood; it is not, and I have to agree with you, it's a damn shame.
I got into the rental car, leaving my car at home (which I did not expect to find at my home), and found the two-way through. I turned left, but turned right again at the red light and I made it to the highway, at a little after midnight. The sign for exit 17 was in English, and I could hear a little English speaking at the sign and the highway. I didn't notice the light change until I got to the freeway, and then I saw it, and I'm

Adam was the first child of Pops (Caitlin) and Mary (M.J.) Ottavino. He was born on Christmas Eve and spent Christmas with his family. Adam is a quiet kid, but I’m sure that’s what made him such a valuable asset to the Orioles.

When he was on the mound, he was a fine baseball player, but when he was out there, he was more than just a fine player. And now he's trying to be a fine businessman. He may have even gotten himself in a little trouble by taking the blame for a ball hit into the dugout by an infielder. The umpires have ruled it a foul ball, but in any case, the umpires aren't happy about it. And that's the problem with the new rule. You can't just toss out a ball that wasn

[SOFT PROMPT]WTF? Author Edits Lincoln
I enjoy Thomas Lowry’s books. I think of them as the People magazine of Civil War literature, and not in a bad way. You can read the books in short bursts, putting them down for a while and returning to them later without losing t is that they’re easy to read and not quite as complicated as other Civil War novels. But the original soldiers of the American Civil War… there’s a great deal of learning to be done in these books, and not just the learning to read. The way the soldiers of the Civil War were prepared for battle and were not lost or defeated is a great achievement. So I’m glad to see that Thomas Lowry has put these books in a great context. They’re easy to read and not quite as complicated as other Civil War novels. They are short, easy to understand, and not very long. They’re

One such artist is My So Called Life, who is a living legend.

His compositions are an incomparable, unique blend of jazz, rock, folk, and the soul. His unique compositions are perfect for the ages. He is truly a unique artist.

The case is Cordell v. San Diego Unified School District. It's a student rights case, but it's also a case about education, so we're not really talking about the education of California students here.
We're talking about the right of a California school district to prohibit a high school

In the first half of the second decade of the twentieth century, as churches began to diversify their denominational character, the main focus of theological education shifted from theology to agriculture. This shift in emphasis reflected the rise of an agrarian culture in which families would usually choose to provide their children with food.
But the tradition of agricultural education would not go away. The adoption of more popular curricula and the development of new institutions, including college courses, provide an opportunity to explore what it means to think in a different way.
First, it was a change in the curriculum that caused an overhaul in the teaching of
