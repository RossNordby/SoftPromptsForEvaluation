[SOFT PROMPT]hide Positive outlook in heart disease tied to fewer deaths
Friday, September 20, 2013 9:20 a.m. EDT
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People with heart disease who are more upbeat and excited tend to live longer than those who don't have such a positive outlook.
There is also evidence that positive mood is related to greater health, even if it is only at the expense of longer-term mortality. When a person is in a good mood, they are healthier, less likely to die of heart disease, and live longer.
While a person who has a positive outlook on life may be healthier and have fewer cardiovascular problems, their lifespan is limited by that outlook.
To get a clearer picture of how mood affects mortality, this research from Sweden shows that, on average, people with a positive outlook on life live 10 years longer than those with a negative outlook.

The U.S. Embassy in the Muslim-majority country of Yemen said on Tuesday it would accept higher bids from China and other companies on the grounds that they are likely to make less than U.S. prices.
The Yemeni government said the country's embassy in Beijing would provide the highest bid.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would provide a second or third bid for Yemeni-made weapons and other equipment.
The Ministry of National Security said it would give its second or third bid for Yemeni-made hardware.

Frank Deford says there'll never be another Tiger Woods of any sport. // AFP/Getty Images, Karim Sahib
Tiger Woods hasn't won a major in six years, and at 38, sor so far as he's concerned, he'll be just fine.

This was the first time Woods has won at the top of the Tour de France, a record that's stood for nine years.

Question: Which will come first, the completion of the Second Avenue Subway or the next Mets World Series victory? Christine Quinn: Well I can’t actually answer that question honestly because my father is 84, and he remembers the da in his early 70s. Which is to say, I can’t answer it either way, so it’s a question of whether it’s worth my time. So we have to just go with the second one.

At least, that’s what I’m doing. It’s the second time I’ve been asked that question. I remember being asked it by the first time. I’m like, well, I don’t know. But I remember that there were two kids in my family that were in the Navy. One of them was my mother’s brother. I remember my mother

25 Breaking Away from a False Dilemma
With a high-school level understanding of science and theology, I was convinced by this "either-or" argument and, to my knowledge, became the first Young Earth Creationist in my local Nazarene church. I trade. It took me six years of study to reach the conclusion that there was a false dilemma, or, as the Hebrew term is called, "a false dilemma of the mind." I finally found the solution: I chose the science over the faith, and the religious over the scientific. My faith was challenged. I had to ask myself: How do I understand this? The answer, for me, is simple: I do not understand it. This is the point where I will stop writing and begin thinking.

[SOFT PROMPT]0 Scientists Tell Their Stories: Owen Gingerich
When it came time to go to graduate school, one of Owen Gingerich's science professors told him “If you feel a calling to go to astronomy, you should give it a try, because we shouldn’t let atheists take over and to teach science. So we have a long way to go, but I believe that we can do better than the atheists that we’ve been led to believe is the case.“
Owen Gingerich's undergraduate career was somewhat of a disaster, but he eventually made the transition to the field of astronomy. Gingerich says that when he first went to college, he was only given the chance to learn physics, so he had to deal with the mental and emotional hurdles of the whole thing. After a year in graduate school, Gingerich had an idea that he wanted to try astronomy.

Reid has not been convicted of any financial crimes
