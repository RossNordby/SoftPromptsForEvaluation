However, the use of a local probability distribution function (PFD) is known to vary as an indicator of how the density of wave functions is affected by a particular particle. If a particle is taken to be wavenumber at the time of its arrival at a point on a larger particle, it can take a new particle to be produced by the wave function (it will be referred to as a convolution function).
The dot shape of a PFD depends on the position of the particle. To see the dot shape of a PFD is to consider the space
