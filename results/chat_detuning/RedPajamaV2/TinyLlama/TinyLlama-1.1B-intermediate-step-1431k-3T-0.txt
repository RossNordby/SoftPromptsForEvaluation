We have a number of convenient methods for generating dates and times:

```php
use Laravel\Nova\Helpers\Generate;

Generate::date();
Generate::dateTime();
Generate::time();
```

In order to see all available methods, you can use the method `generate()`. For example, the following example generates a random date between 10/1/2018 and 10/31/2

## Overview

This GDK is an open source library that provides the foundation for games developed in the Unity engine.

In addition to the C# bindings, there are Python bindings available for some of the functionality of the G

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers are reconsidering a 1990 law that makes the State Department accept the lowest bids for contracts for security services at its embassies and consulates, but does not require the department to give preference to firms with U.S. government contracts.
In 1990, Congress set a contracting threshold for security firms at $20 million annually. That threshold was to be raised in 2007 to $40 million, but was left unchanged in 2010, making it easier for firms to bid on lower-value contracts.

Logan • Through two seasons at Utah State, seven car· sophomore running back Joe Hill, who will be a big contributor this fall, didn't get a lot of snaps during the first two games.
But it's just a matter of time before Hill starts getting some carries, and it's probably not going to be a season-changing type of start.
In the Aggies' first two games of the season, Hill had four carries for 13 yards and caught four passes for 21 yards. He also caught a touchdown pass from Jake Bentley.

Social Security Numbers: a Non-Issue
I have written before about the security of the Social Security Death Index and its use as a very effective too; my most recent post at the TGGP is available here. The main point of that post was that Social Security numbers are no longer being used as the identifier for deaths. I have no idea why that is. The State Department uses a number that is not even on the social security card. The Census Bureau uses a number that is not even on the census form. The New York Times even admits that Social Security numbers are not the best identifier. It is certainly the best identifier for people who have used Social Security Numbers for a period of time, but it is not the best identifier. The TGGP also has

Before taking this class, I had a certain appreciate for hip-hop but did not spend much of my time immersed in the music or anecdotes about it. When I started taking this class, I learned about the world of hip-hop through some old men's eyes, which is an eye-opening experience. I now see the music as a means of expressing and asserting one's individuality and identity in ways that are often misunderstood. It is also important to note that in my hip-hop class, we are not a collective. We are all individual voices that are pushing the hip-hop culture forward.
I also found it interesting to hear about the different hip-hop sub-cultures
