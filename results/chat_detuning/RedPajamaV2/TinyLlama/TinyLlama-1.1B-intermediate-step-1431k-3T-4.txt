# Introduction

We will look at two popular methods of evaluating software, which have received a lot of attention in the academic literature. We will see that these methods differ significantly in their strengths and weaknesses, and that the research on these methods is still in its infancy. We will discuss the major advantages and disadvantages of these methods, and we will show that these two methods are very similar in practice.

It is my hope that the examples provided will serve as a point of reference to help guide you in building and extending your own application. As with all things, there is no one right answer and you are responsible for making your own decisions. As with any cross-platform application, there are a number of things to consider and as a cross-platform application you should expect to be impacted by both the operating system and the hardware. To that end, I will try to highlight
