For a brief time in 2008, Linux actually owned a segment of the desktop industry: netbooks. When netbooks first showed up, they ran only Linux. Microsoft panicked anM slightly changed Linux and sold to die-hard Linux users. The result was that the Linux netbook market had been established, and Linux was not that popular on desktops. But the lesson has not been lost on developers, who are now beginning to see Linux desktop desktops as a real and viable business opportunity.
One reason Linux desktops are now getting a second look is that they are getting smarter. This is not only because the development is faster, but because developers are seeing the value in them.

Pate, the Supreme Court of the United States, which had held the rule was constitutional, denied the writ. Cordell, of course, had been convicted of the murder of a police officer.
