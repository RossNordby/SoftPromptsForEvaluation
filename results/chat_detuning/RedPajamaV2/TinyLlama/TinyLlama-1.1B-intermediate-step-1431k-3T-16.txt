The primary requirement for all subnets in a network is that they have a security group associated with them. The security group allows you to define a set of rules that govern the traffic that flows through the subnet. For example, a security group can allow all traffic to pass, allow only TCP traffic, allow only IPv4 traffic, allow only HTTP traffic, or allow only HTTPS traffic.

I need some clarification hand I'm hoping some good people will help me. What exactly is Friedmanite Anarcho-Capitalism? What is Chicago School of Economics?
I was reading this site and I think I see it. I'm a little confused because the post was in reference to some guy named Rothbard who is a Friedmanite Anarcho-Capitalist.
Could someone give me a good explanation of Friedmanite Anarcho-Capitalism and the Chicago School of Economics?

It’s almost like Fall had been hiding behind the Labor Day corner, just waiting to pounce. Despite the cold (and if it’s even 50 outside), I’m getting ready to go to the States for the week. I have been thinking a lot about what I’m going to say to my students in my classroom. I want to create a space that encourages them to think about what they are passionate about. I want to encourage them to see the beauty in each and every person and to value all people. I want to encourage them to look at the world in a new way.

But the Kia Optima Hybrid was a different story. The car was compact, nimble and reasonably well equipped. It offered up to 20 mpg in the city and on the highway, and had the stiffness and performance of a smaller vehicle. And it was certainly a lot more stylish than a Sonata.

[SOFT PROMPT]<s> WTF? Author Edits Lincoln
