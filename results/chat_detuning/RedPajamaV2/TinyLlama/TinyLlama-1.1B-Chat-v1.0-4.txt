Linux’s success in the netbook space was driven by Linux being so lightweight and easy to install. Linux netbooks were far cheaper than Windows-based netbooks, and that was because of the absence of expensive graphics cards, wireless access points, and other hardware that Windows requires. The netbook was a great solution for users who want a thin, lightweight
